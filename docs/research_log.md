## Sensor Extraction

### Compute manifest on FILTER data

**After running:**

```bash
python scripts/01_build_sensor_manifest.py --config configs/pipeline.yaml
```

**Output:**

```text
Sofia location-sensor pairs: 1024
Plausible continuing pairs: 423
```

**Further relevant information:**

```text
Historical FILTER files: 1,958
Unique candidate sensor IDs: 420
Distinct candidate coordinates: approximately 415
```

Suggests relatively strong initial position to continue pursuing the route of using sensor-community dataset. There are 423 location records with 415 distinct coordinate positions. Further inspection of `sofia_sensor_manifest.csv` suggests that initial historical coverage is encouraging.

- 133 started reporting in 2018;
- 204 started before 2020;
- 343 contain at least 8,760 historical QC-valid hours, equivalent to one full year of hourly data;
- median candidate contains 28,623 raw historical hours;
- median historical QC-pass rate is 96.5%.

**Further considerations:**

Considering 133 started reporting in 2018, and 204 before 2020, methodology could relax the 2018 date to 2020. Theoretically, four years of data should be sufficient for training.

### Extract Sensor.Community archive data

Following section reads the computed `sofia_sensor_manifest.csv`, retains 423 rows marked as `plausible_continuing`, reduce these to the 420 available unique sensor IDs and requests one archive file per sensor and date.

**Note:** this considers the files for the period 01.2024 - 31.03.2026.

**After running:**

```bash
python scripts/02_download_archive.py --config configs/pipeline.yaml
```

while true; do
    clear

    completed=$(wc -l < "$ledger" | tr -d ' ')
    downloaded=$(grep -c '"status": "downloaded"' "$ledger")
    cached=$(grep -c '"status": "cached"' "$ledger")
    missing=$(grep -c '"status": "missing"' "$ledger")
    percentage=$(awk -v c="$completed" 'BEGIN {printf "%.1f", c / 344820 * 100}')

    date
    echo
    echo "Completed:  $completed / 344820 ($percentage%)"
    echo "Downloaded: $downloaded"
    echo "Cached:     $cached"
    echo "Missing:    $missing"

    sleep 10
done
```
